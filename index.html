							<h2>Add A Feature.</h2>
							<p>It might not have occurred to you yet, but a new roof actually opens up a whole variety of possibilities. You can add skylights, dormer windows, vents, even a new chimney if you wanted to combine your re-roofing with other renovations. Since you're already tearing the old roof out, you can simply integrate new features into the new roof's design..</p>

							<h2>Curb Appeal.</h2>
							<p>Almost no one realizes how their porch really affects the outside impression of the home until there's something to compare it to. Your old porch may be subtly sagging, faded, dirty, or showing signs of wear that are hard to notice at a distance but compile into an older-looking house. A new porch, properly shaped and beautifully colored, adds fantastic curb appeal to any home whether you're selling or not.</p>

							<h2>Outdoors, and the living is good.</h2>
							<p>A patio adds flexible outdoor space to a home at a relatively affordable cost. Constructing a complete sunroom addition can be expensive, but patio paving and roofing have a higher return on investment in increased home value. Additionally, patios allow better integration of indoor and outdoor areas for a seamless living space.</p>

							<h2>Kitchens that work for your lifestyle.</h2>
							<p>Whether your house is your forever home or you’re planning to sell in a few years remodelling your kitchen is always a smart investment. Kitchen renovations have one of the highest returns on investment for home improvements, increasing the value of your home.

							<h2>Better bathroom time.</h2>
							<p>You can install several features during renovation that will cut your energy bill almost in half. Among them are low-flow toilets, underfloor heating and fixtures aimed at saving water. Installing windows that will help to avoid having to turn on the fan for long periods of time to prevent walls gathering moisture, mirrors from fogging up and generally will provide more air to keep the bathroom clean and well-ventilated.</p>

							<h2>Roots.</h2>

We carry you with us in our hearts every day.</p>
